This is a project with the objective of finding a good way to predict housing prices based on various attributes of a given area, and thus to provide information on real estate which may be under, or overpriced. The dataset used is the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository. The datapoints represent block areas containing 600-3000 people (the smallest geographical unit for which the US census bureau publishes data). This project used supervised learning.

I used StratifiedShuffleSplit to split the test set based on strata determined by the median income which is the label. Then explored the correlation both statistically with a corr matrix and visually with scatter plots, determined the attributes which were significantly correlated with the median house price and those that were not. This information prompted the creation of new attributes by combining some of the particularly relevant ones. Next I filled NA values with the median of thier respective attributes and transformed text attributes using one-hot encoding, then created a pipeline for the whole data preproccessing activity.

Several different models were then tested, including DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and SupportVectorRegressor. Both GridSearchCV and RandomForestCV were used for fine tuning and ultimately the RandomForestRegressor was the highest performing model with a root mean squared error of 47000.
